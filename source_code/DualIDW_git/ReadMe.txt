This is a SGeMS (the Stanford Geostatistical Modeling Software) plug-in, which implements 
a dual inverse distance weighting (DIDW) interpolation. 

All programs are writen in c++.
 
To compile this plug-in, two conditions should be satisfied: 
(1) Python X64 version is required to be installed (https://www.python.org/downloads/); 
it is also available in our prepared folder:"Compiled_exe_programs\prerequisite"; 
(2) As required by SGeMS, Microsoft VS2008 is needed. 

Besides, it is strongly suggested to complie the full SGeMS (http://sgems.sourceforge.net/ ).
